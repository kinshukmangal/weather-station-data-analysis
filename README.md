# 🌦 Weather Station Data Analysis

This project explores environmental data collected from weather stations using a combination of data cleaning and simulation in MATLAB. It focuses on making raw weather data usable for analysis and provides sample cleaned datasets and code used in modeling.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Sample Cleaned Data Files from Raw Weather Data/`  
  Contains cleaned and formatted datasets derived from raw weather station data. These files are used in later simulations and visualizations.

- `Sample Weather Station Matlab Files/`  
  Includes MATLAB scripts and figures for processing and analyzing weather data, with operations like data interpolation, plotting, and statistical modeling.

- `Link to Data Repository/`  
  This folder contains an external reference to the full raw dataset, hosted elsewhere for size or access reasons.
